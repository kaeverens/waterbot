the bot is made of three separate layers

the bottom layer is the Transport layer. this layer has a motor and wheels, and has switches to identify when the bot hits a track end, or when it passes a marker on the track to identify where the pots are.

the middle layer is for power and control. this layer has an embedded arduino, battery, and battery charger, and it controls the robot.

the top layer is the syringe layer. this layer is used to pick up and drop off water.
