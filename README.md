a robot for watering plants

I don't know much about gardening, and I am not attentive enough to stick to a watering regime, so this is a project to do it for me.

The idea is that you place the plants you want to water in a line along a track. A small robot then travels along that track, watering each plant.

There is a much larger idea behind all of this, but I'll get to that over time. The short-term goal is that plants should each receive a prescribed amount of water every day.
